## Hey there 👋

I'm a curious mind wired for hacking, AI, and building tech that challenges the norm.  
From dissecting systems to designing smarter solutions, I love breaking things open just to understand how they breathe.

### 💻 What I Do
- 🥷🏼 Explore offensive security, ethical hacking & reverse engineering  
- 🧩 Tinker with AI to build smarter, leaner systems  
- 🧠 Constantly learning, shipping, and iterating on ideas that excite me  
- 🛡️ Deep into tools, exploits, and everything under the hood 
- 🧪 Researching on AI system vulnerabilities and LLM behavior

### 🧰 Tech Playground

Linux | Python | Bash | Git | Wireshark | Nmap | Metasploit | AI Research
